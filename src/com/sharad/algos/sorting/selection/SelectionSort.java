/*
 * 	In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort.
 *  It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than
 *  the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages
 *  over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
 *  
 *  The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: 
 *  the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, 
 *  and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. 
 *  Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. 
 *  The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) 
 *  element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), 
 *  and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
